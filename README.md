# Neurolabs code challenge

Challenge:

>     1. Create a web app with a dedicated front and backend (React & FastAPI).
>     2. Save data in a single table and display it on the frontend.
>
> This task should be a starting point of development. We want to see how you tackle different application development topics. If time is an issue on your end, we can also work with projects you have been working on before, however providing us with a GitHub repo before the interview will help us greatly. We expect certain topics to be addressed without us explicitly listing them for this assignment. Feel free to have open pitfalls where you might not have an answer right away. We want to know that your awareness towards application development does not only evolve around features.
